# Flutter Version Fix Applied ✅

## 🐛 Issue Resolved
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing because it was using Flutter version `3.19.0`, but your project requires Dart SDK version `^3.9.0`, which needs Flutter `3.35.1` or higher.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed
Updated all workflow files to use Flutter version `3.35.1`:

- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Updated Flutter version in all 3 jobs
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated Flutter version
- ✅ `SETUP.md` - Updated documentation to reflect correct version

## 📋 Current Flutter Version
All workflows now use:
```yaml
flutter-version: '3.35.1'
```

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Commit and push** these changes to trigger the workflow again
2. The workflow should now successfully:
   - Install Flutter 3.35.1
   - Resolve dependencies (Dart SDK 3.9.0+)
   - Run tests
   - Build the example app
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

## 💡 Why This Happened
- Your `pubspec.yaml` specifies `sdk: ^3.9.0`
- Flutter 3.19.0 only includes Dart SDK 3.3.0
- Flutter 3.35.1 includes Dart SDK 3.9.0+
- The workflow needed to match your project requirements

The fix ensures compatibility between your project's SDK requirements and the CI/CD environment.
